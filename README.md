# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation in the project was to develope a working webpage. The reason why I built this project was to solve a problem and knowing that if I was to complete the project no matter how hard the project was, I would feel happy knowing that I completed a task that was difficult. The problem that this project solves is allowing me to have access and see what I have learned to help me prepare for the boot camp class. I learned not only how to make webpage though I had no exprience in this kind of field and work.
